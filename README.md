# Surf Log
The surf log was created to help me document surf sessions throughout the year. As I get older, free time seems to be tough to find. Surfing is one of my favorite hobbies, however, I often pass up the opportunity to go surfing because it's been so long. The surf log will allow me to reminisce about past sessions, helping motivate me to get back in the water! 

## To Get Started
To get started, run the following command in the project directory:

 `npm installed`

Once NPM has been installed, run:

 `npm start`

Now that the React application is up and running, we'll need to spin up the server. You can run:

 `npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`

Once the server is up and running, you're ready to use the App

## Using the App
The App consists of a Home, About, Weather, New Session, and Sessions pages. The Home page will eventually house pictures from past surf trips but for now, it's using a stock photo to help keep the stock alive. 

The About page gives the user more information on why the project was created. 


The new session page allows the user to create a post about their most recent surf session. Once a new session is submitted, the user is redirected to the Sessions page. 

The Sessions page hosts all the posts. This allows the user to look back and reminisce about past sessions. 

In the future, the weather data may also help users make informed decisions on when to go out. Since free time is short, the wave data and session notes should motivate us to get out there even when the forecast isn't promising!
